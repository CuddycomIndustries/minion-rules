# Building a Minion DFIR playbook

This repository contains a starter `rules` file for using [Minion](https://gitlab.com/CinCan/minion) for DFIR work.

This initial version will cover a basic Windows memory foresics basic playbook that hopefully other people can then build upon and get to know the tool.

You should definitely go read Minion's own documentation to unleash its full power.
